                primary explanatory models have competed for ascendancy: (1) rogue
                individuals from the US Military Police unit engaged in bad behavior (i.e.
                the 'bad apple' explanation); (2) somewhere up the chain of command
                individual officers gave orders that ultimately led to the abuse of Iraqi
                prisoners (i.e. the 'following orders' explanation); or (3) abuses were the
                product of failed leadership by specific persons who did not clearly
                communicate norms or adequately monitor and supervise underlings (i.e.
                the 'failed leadership' explanation).
                The first explanation ('bad apples') is exemplified in the military's court
                martial proceedings for soldiers who directly interacted with Iraqi prisoners,
                as well as in the Bush Administration's claim-from the moment the
                allegations of abuse first came forward-that the abusive behavior was
                atypical of the military and simply bad behavior on the part of a few ourof-
                control soldiers (see Graham, 2004; Higham and Stevens, 2004; White
                and Higham, 2004). The second explanation ('following orders') is exemplified
                by the defense in the court martial proceedings who have tried to
                identify specific persons (e.g. Military Intelligence personnel, civilian contractors,
                Pentagon officials) up the chain of command who ordered the
                Military Police officers to use abusive techniques to 'soften up' Iraqi
                prisoners in order to elicit information from them (see Cha and McCarthy,
                2004; Cha and Merle, 2004; Higham et al., 2004; Vedantam, 2004; White
                and Allen, 2004 ). The third explanation ('failed leadership') is exemplified
                by accusations that mid- to high-ranking military officials (e.g. US Brig.
                Gen. Janis Karpinski) failed to adequately train, monitor or supervise
                troops on the ground, and failed to respond to early warning signs of
                problems within the prison (see Graham and Ricks, 2004; Smith, 2004;
                Taguba, 2004; White and Higham, 2004). Each of these explanations
                focuses on the personal failures of individuals within the military (albeit at
                ascending hierarchical levels) to act in legal, ethical or moral ways. Each of
                these explanations also deflects attention from both the organizational
                environment and the environment of the organization within which
                a buses occurred.1
                In contrast, criminological accounts of corporate and occupational deviance
                have identified a variety of ways in which deviant behavior by
                individuals is shaped by organizational context and processes. Some researchers
                have focused on power relationships in organizations and how
                those relationships can generate deviance (see Vandivier, 1972), others on
                how cognitive processes that emerge in organizational settings may produce
                deviant behavior (see Kelman and Hamilton, 1989; Gioia, 1992), and
                yet others have examined how socialization processes in organizations and
                society can lead to the normalization of deviance (Skolnick and Fyfe, 1993;
                Hochstetler and Copes, 2001; Crelinsten, 2003 ). In addition, Vaughan
                (1982) has examined how the sheer structural complexity of organizations
                may facilitate deviance in organizations, while Jackall (1988) and Pearce
                (2001) focused on the relationship between formal control systems in
                organizations and organizational deviance.

          Although criminologists recognize the importance of formal organizations
as structures and sites of action, historically based distinctions
between occupational deviance and corporate (or, more broadly, organizational)
deviance continue to obscure the interconnections between these
phenomena. Studies of occupational crime consider the organization as a
context for deviant behavior to explain the decision making and actions of
those within organizations, frequently lower- and mid-level actors. In so
doing, however, they often fail to account for the embedded context of the
organization itself (or at least limit the factors considered, e.g. to economic
conditions) or the possibility that such 'crime' may directly or indirectly
enhance organizational effectiveness. Studies of corporate deviance, on the
other hand, begin with the legal fiction of the corporation as 'individual'
and seek to explain the organization's deviant actions. This line of work,
however, runs the risk of anthropomorphizing the organization, treating it
as if it had human motivations and capacity to act (Cressey, 1988).
Organizational structure is the product of decisions made by those with the
authority to establish such structure. When viewed in this way, the creation
of structure is as much the product of human agency as is the occupational
crime of lower-level participants. In addition, as Glasberg and Skidmore
have noted, studies of organizational deviance have tended to imply 'a
focus on the internal structure of the organization itself as if the organization
exists independently of external forces that might create relations,
processes, and structures within organizations' (1998: 426). Thus, calls for
definitional clarity in the study of white-collar crime ( e.g. Braithwaite,
1985), though well placed, have produced a degree of fragmentation across
levels of analysis.
Rather than hold fast to the distinction between corporate and occupational
crime, the present article considers simultaneously organizations and
the environments of organizations as contexts for human action. Specifically,
we explore the relationship between (1) strategically designed and
implemented structures and (2) deviant and criminal acts perpetrated at
lower levels of the organization. Organizations are more than just incidental
or neutral locations where deviant behavior occurs. The role of
organizations, and their leaders and managers, often extends beyond a
failure to do certain things ( e.g. monitor, prevent, punish, respond with
sufficient vehemence) to include implementing strategies for formal structure
that facilitate deviance by participants and make such deviance
both predictable and a predicate of organizational 'success'. Specifically, we
identify how organizations, through aspects of their formal structure
and strategies for eliding this formal structure, play a significant facilitating
and causal role in the deviance that occurs within them. In this,
our approach parallels Vaughan's (1982, 1997) multilevel analysis of
organizational deviance. We extend her analysis by offering a more general
theoretical framework that draws on neo-institutional organizational
theory (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983, 1991;
Scott, 2001 ).

          Neo-institutionalist theories conceive of formal organizations as deeply
permeated by broader cultural forces. As Scott argues: 'Socially constructed
belief and rule systems exercise enormous control over organizations-both
how they are structured and how they carry out their work' (2003: 120).
Neo-institutionalists thus challenge traditional ideas about the rationality
of organizational structure and call into question whether the primary
purpose of formal structure is to monitor, constrain and evaluate behavior
within organizations. Instead, the theory's proponents argue that independent
of its technical rationality, organizational structure is institutionalized,
that is, 'taken for granted as legitimate, apart from evaluation of [its]
impact on work outcomes' (Meyer and Rowan, 1977: 344). Institutionalized
structures enhance organizational stability by symbolizing, for external
constituencies, the organization's conformity with broader cultural
rules and expectations.
In this article, we examine what actually happens under the cover of
institutionalized structure by focusing on the empirical observation of decoupling.
When operating in complex and competing institutional ( or
'rule') environments, organizations are often formally organized so as to
shear structure (the blueprint for organizational action) from action (what
actually happens on the ground). That is, formal statements of how and
why things should be done are decoupled from how they are actually done.
In so doing, organizations satisfy environmental demands by demonstrating
appropriate structure and policies while simultaneously freeing lowerlevel
employees to effectively and efficiently meet the organization's
technical goals. Not surprisingly, in decoupled organizations, flexibilityincluding
the willingness to violate formal rules in the pursuit of organizational
goals-is a highly valued quality among workers (Meyer and
Rowan, 1977). Although organizational sociologists have long known that
informal structure is pervasive in formal organizations (e.g. Selznick, 1948;
Dalton, 1959; Jackall, 1988; Van Maanen, 1991; Scott, 2003), neoinstitutional
theory suggests organizational mechanisms by which informal
structure may be systematically linked to formal structure. That is, the
unofficial relationships and patterns of behavior that exist alongside formal
policies and structures may be more than accidental or incidental: they may
be the product of decoupling as a formal organizational strategy.
Previous research on deviance in for-profit organizations has identified
decoupling as a contributing factor, although researchers have not used the
term 'decoupling' nor do they connect their arguments to the work of neoinstitutional
theorists of organizations. For example, in their independent
discussions of the effects of the 'finance mode of control' in organizations,
Jackall (1988) and Pearce (2001) argue that: (1) for-profit organizations
may manage conflicts between imperatives for profit and for adherence to
external regulations and norms by implementing a finance mode of control
where formal responsibility for how work is accomplished is pushed down
the hierarchy; (2) financial information alone is conveyed up the chain of

          command; and (3) workers at the bottom of the hierarchy have flexibility
in how things get done. Pearce concludes that this control strategy:
Explains why so many safety, health and environmental violations are the
effects of the policies of higher management without this necessarily being
traceable to any specific decisions that they have made about product
quality, health and safety. It maximizes the likelihood of 'willful blindness'
(Wilson, 1979) since it allows those at the top to be ignorant of the activities
of subordinates and to ignore the difficulties that subordinates face.
(Pearce, 2001: 44; see also Braithwaite, 1984; Pearce and Tombs, 1998)
Simply put, when organizational leaders set financial goals for subunits and
set their workers loose to pursue those goals, they encourage normviolating
behavior while simultaneously buffering themselves from accountability
for the actions of lower-level participants. Both Jackall (1988)
and Pearce (2001 ), however, limit their analysis to the context of for-profit
organizations and to the goal of profit making.
The effects of conflicting norms on individual behavior have also been
extensively developed in the criminological literature. Specifically, strain
theory suggests that non-conformist behavior may result when the achievement
of societal goals is blocked by overly restrictive institutionalized
means (Merton, 1938; Cloward, 1959; Dubin, 1959; Agnew, 1992).
Vaughan (1982, 1997) has argued for the application of strain/anomie
theory to organizational as well as individual behavior. In doing so, she
(1) applies the notion of opportunity structures to organizations; and (2)
advances a reconceptualization of Merton's distinction between means and
goals-at least in the context of organizational deviance-as 'scarce resources
for which both individuals and organizations compete' (1997: 98).
In her analysis of the Challenger disaster, Vaughan attributes faulty decision
making at NASA to the larger contradictory environment-what she
labels 'a triumvirate of conflicting cultural imperatives' (1997: 113)-in
which NASA operated. In this analysis, Vaughan connects the decision
making of individuals within NASA to the larger cultural environment of
the organization via organizational structures and practices. In an environment
of scarce resources and competition (for contracts, in the case of
NASA contractors, or public funding, in the case of NASA), and conflicting
cultures, 'organization structure facilitates misconduct as a solution to
blocked opportunities by creating structural secrecy . . . [ and by] providing
difficult-to-monitor mechanisms for carrying out illegal acts that conceal
rather than reveal' (1997: 100).
In this article, we argue that decoupling is a more general process that
plays out in a variety of organizational types (e.g. for-profit organizations,
but also state and professional organizations). In particular, the environments
of organizations may be contradictory in ways that extend beyond
competition for profit or for scarce resources. Neo-institutional theory
offers a general framework in which we may consider organizations as
contexts and also the context of organizations, or what we term the

          embedded context of organizations. This approach provides a general
framework in which to simultaneously consider (1) the macro-level contradictions
faced by organizations; (2) how such conflicting norms shape
organizational structures (usually via the actions of upper-level organizational
actors); and (3) how such structures influence individual behavior.
More specifically, we explore how organizational structure mediates
between the larger rule environment and organizational participants, and
how particular structural arrangements arrived at by the conscious choices
of managers, executives and leaders facilitate flexible, and sometimes
deviant, responses by organizational participants to conflicted institutional
environments. In such structures, rule-breaking behavior is to be expected.
By explicitly linking macro-level rule environments, organizational structure
and participant behavior, we challenge explanations for deviance in
organizations that presume neutrality on the part of the organizational
structure and those who design and implement that structure.
In developing this general framework of organizational deviance we
draw on two disparate empirical cases: (1) the abuses by American military
personnel at the prison in Abu Ghraib; and (2) the falsification of internship
records by architects-in-training. Using these cases-usefully aligned
on opposite ends of the spectrum of severity and notoriety-we illustrate
how deviance is produced by organizations when the organization decouples
structure from action. In particular, we examine: ( 1) organizational
strategies that simultaneously elaborate and trivialize formal structure as a
social control mechanism; (2) behaviors on the part of individual participants
(including formal rule violations) that occur in, and contribute to the
effectiveness of, organizations facing complex and competing institutional
environments; and (3) the complex environment in which organizations
exist that influences the extent to which structure is decoupled from action
in organizations.
The cases: Abu Ghraib prison and architectural
internship
Abu Ghraib
The Abu Ghraib prison abuses came to light in the spring of 2004 when
photographs, taken in the autumn of 2003, of Iraqi prisoners being abused
by American soldiers were nationally televised on 60 Minutes II. By that
time, numerous investigations of the prison abuses had been completed or
were underway, including investigations by the International Red Cross
and US Army General Antonio Taguba (ultimately released as the Taguba
Report). Congressional hearings followed during the summer of 2004.
Explanations for the deviant behavior varied from 'bad apple' prison
guards to prison guards claiming to be 'following orders' to 'poor leadership'
by superior military officers. The Abu Ghraib prison was but one of
numerous prisons set up in Iraq following the American occupation.2">
